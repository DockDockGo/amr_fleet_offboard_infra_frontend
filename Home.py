    This webapp serves as a stand-in replacement for the fully automated lego assembly testbed in development at Carnegie Mellon University's Manufacturing Futures Institute.
    
    Its purpose is two-fold:
    1. To **emulate the commands that will be sent to the testbed's transportation layer**: a fleet of automated mobile robots (AMRs) developed by a team of student roboticists from the Robotics Institute at CMU
    2. Providing **user-interfaces that provide manipulation instructions to human operators** at the different work cells of the testbed. This allows for a full **demo of the testbed's transportation infrastructure capabilities using AMRs** while the automated robot arms that will later be performing the manipulation tasks are in development.
